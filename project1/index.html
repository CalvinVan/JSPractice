Project 1: Button that changes background color.

Notes of things that I have learned from this project.

1. HTML: simple shift+1 and enter will give you the default html structure that is
used in most index html files. 

2.HTML:  You put javascript scripts in the body.

3. HTML: BootstrapCDN is something that allows you to load in css, javascript, and images
 that are found in its servers.

 5. CSS : There is an element called vh which is view height which considers the current
 height of the window that the user is viewing. The number that you put will
 be between 1-100 which is a percent
 
 6. JS: This is my first time working with Java so a lot to learn! Something that is
 notable to me is that you declare functions with the word function and variables
 with var. You also connect javascript scripts to html by using 
 document.getElementsByTagName("tagname")[#] <- which one / number

Ok, I have to admit that implementing the random colors was a lot harder than I'd like to admit
since I am not familiar with the syntax.
1. generating a random number is pretty intuitive 
2. What was tricky was that if you want to use document.getelement. You need to
end the line with a period.
3. If you want to use template strings, you wil need to use backtick marks and not
single quotation marks
